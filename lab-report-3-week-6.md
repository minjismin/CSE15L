## Streamlining ssh Configuration

### 1

![ssh config](show ssh config file.png)

I created config file which contained 

```
Host ieng6
  HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
  User cs15lsp22aqj
```

By creating this I could login to ieng6 remote server by just typing >ssh ieng 6


### 2

![login ssh with ieng6](log in ssh  and scpusing ieng6.png)

So as I said, I could login using ieng6 and also could copy the file from my local account by using command "scp"


## Setup Github Access from ieng6

### 1
I created new public key to access my github account

![github public key](public key stored in github.png)

### 2
My private key is saved under the file named id_rsa

![private key saved](private key in id_rsa.png)

### 3
By setting up that, I could commit and push while I logged into ieng6 account
